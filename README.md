# Batman Job Application Form 🦇

This project is a **fun and creative HTML + CSS form**, styled as a fictional job application for Batman.

The goal wasn’t realism or production readiness — it was to make something enjoyable while practicing **form structure, layout, and visual styling** using only core frontend technologies.

Projects like this keep learning interesting. When building feels fun, consistency follows.
